# Automatic-Colorization-Of-Image-Using-Neural-Network
Automatic image colorization using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a process where a neural network learns to add color to black-and-white images. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. Collecting Data
We start with a large set of color images. Each image is turned into a black-and-white version, so we have pairs of black-and-white and corresponding color images.

2. Building the CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for the colorization task. Here's how it works:

Layers: The CNN consists of multiple layers that process the image. Each layer extracts different features from the image, like edges, shapes, and textures.
Encoder-Decoder Structure:
Encoder: This part of the network compresses the black-and-white image into a simpler, lower-dimensional representation.
Decoder: This part then takes this simplified representation and tries to reconstruct it as a color image.

3. Training the CNN
The CNN learns by looking at many pairs of black-and-white and color images. It tries to predict the colors for the black-and-white images. During training, the network compares its colorized output with the actual color image and adjusts itself to improve accuracy.

4. Predicting Colors
Colors are often predicted in a color space that separates brightness from color, like the LAB color space:

L (Lightness): This comes from the original black-and-white image.
A and B (Color Components): These are predicted by the CNN.

5. Combining the Results
The predicted color components (A and B) are combined with the lightness (L) from the black-and-white image to create a fully colorized image.

6. Refining the Image
Sometimes, additional steps are taken to fine-tune the colors and fix any minor issues, making the final image look more natural and realistic.

7.Applications
Historical Photos: Adding color to old black-and-white photographs.
Art and Design: Helping artists add color to their sketches or designs.
Medical Imaging: Enhancing black-and-white medical scans for better interpretation.
Popular Techniques
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): These networks create more realistic colors by using two networks that work together to improve the results.
U-Net Architecture: This is a type of CNN with additional connections that help preserve details and improve the quality of the colorization.
